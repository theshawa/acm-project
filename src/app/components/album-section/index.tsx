            In 2013, Sting released the albumÂ The Last Ship, which drew
            inspiration from his childhood. He spent his early years not far
            from the shipyards of Wallsend, a Newcastle neighborhood. Singer and
            actor Jimmy Nail contributed vocals to the album and he also helped
            Sting develop a musical based on the album.
